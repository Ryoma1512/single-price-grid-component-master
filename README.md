## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework


### Continued development

I need to practice more in my responsive design to avoid width issues in differents devices. Keep practice CSS Grids.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind color shades](https://javisperez.github.io/tailwindcolorshades/) - This helped me to generate color code to apply to my tailwind config.
